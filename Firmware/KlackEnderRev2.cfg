## Basic instructions ##
########################

#With this config you will set the probe as your z endstop. This makes the initial setup a bit more tricky than with the Rev1.
#The printer will set you bed position as Z0 (because it probes on that).
#You have to roughtly position the Probe_Retainer for the first setup before you can set the final position. The !top! of the arm has to be roughtly 1mm above the bed.
#To find the perfect position of the Probe_Retainer you have to home the z axis. After this the probe will be at the new Z0 position.
#Place the Probe_Retainer close to the block so there's just a small gap between them.

##Attention!##
#Youre using the Probe as your Z endstop. This means that the position Z0 is also affected by your Z offset.
#Keeep that in mind when positioning the Probe_Retainer
#You might have to change the position of the Probe_Retainer after you set your z offset (0.x mm changes wouldn't changes that much but for everything >1mm you should check its positioning).
#And a kindly reminder to adapt the [probe] pin, set the virtual endstop, set the y min posistion.

# !! Change your Z endstop pin from 'endstop_pin: Pin123' to 'endstop_pin: probe:z_virtual_endstop'
# !! Also add in [stepper_y] 'position_min: -8'. Idk why but most configs mave this wrong. For the Stock Ender 3 the homed Y position is -8.

fade_start: 1

#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is set
#   to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in the mesh.
#   Users that wish to converge to the z homing position should set this to 0.
#   Default is the average z value of the mesh.
split_delta_z: 0.015
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will
#   trigger a split. Default is .025.
move_check_distance: 3
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
mesh_pps: 4,4
#   A comma separated pair of integers (X,Y) defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed
#   point. The user may enter a single value which will be applied
#   to both axes.  Default is 2,2.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above
#   may be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated.
#   Larger numbers will increase the amount of slope, which
#   results in more curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.

#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) describing the location of each bed "pivot point". The
#   "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
#   stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the X, Y position
#   of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
#   first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
#   the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.
points:
    4,96.5
    219,96.5
#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a Z_TILT_ADJUST command.
#   Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe is above
#   the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. This parameter must be
#   provided.
speed: 100
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 15
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
retries: 10
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
retry_tolerance: 0.01
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance. Note the smallest unit of
#   change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
#   more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.
