### What is this about?

Adaptation of the [Klicky](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe)/[Quickdraw](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe) Probe for the Ender 3 and comparable Creality printers. The probe is compatible with all printers that use the X plate of the Ender 3 and cost of the probe is <10‚Ç¨, of which the switch is the most expensive part.
The probe is compatible with Marlin and Klipper. Both firmwares work with the G29 command, the docking is done automatically by the printer, it couldn't be easier! Both firmwares add a KlackEnder menu to the display that can be used to dock and undock the Probe. The Bed-Mesh can be created via the custom menu, via the default firmware settings or with G29.


### Is it compatible with my printer?

As long as your printer uses a X-Axis plate that's similar to the one of the Ender 3: **YES!***
* You might have to adapt the parts (slightly) if you're not using an Ender 3 or the stock x-plate. See the Basic-Check section to check the basic measurements and see if you printer is compatible. If not and you really struggle with CAD just ping me on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/xqpKrxt9FC) ;)


### Why should I build it?

Well, as with my other mods, the focus is on the best cost-benefit ratio. The KlackEnder is very cheap and very easy to build. No need to pay 40-50‚Ç¨ for a probe that is still affected by heat, takes forever to mesh, and causes a lot of headaches to wire. For the Klack it's: Print - assemble - mount - start printing, that's it. Especially with Klipper, setup couldn't be easier, just use my pre-made macros, copy and paste, hit restart and you're ready for the next print.


#### Quick Overview:

- Compatible with Marlin and Klipper. Easy setup - firmware changes provided.
- 100% automatic probe docking and undocking.
- 100% open source parametric design! With the supported CAD file and instructions, it couldn't be easier to customize the parts to your needs! Even if you've never worked with CAD before, I promise you can customize the parts any way you want!
- Custom menu to control the probe (not for Ender 3 V2 with Jyers GUI).
- The cheapest way to get a fast and very accurate probing ( sample range of 1-2 microsteps (0.000-0.005mm with 16 microsteps)
- Easy to install, no soldering, no complicated wiring
- Works with all pressure surfaces, not affected by heat, no heat soak required

#### Parametric CAD Design

I always try my best to support a wide range of possible setups so you don't have to deal with CAD. With this design I have gone one step further: Not only does this design support a wide range of setups, but also the CAD is very easy to adapt for anyone, even if you've never worked with CAD before!


**How that? Parametric design!**

Parametric design means that everything is based on variables / parameters which you can easily change. The design itself adapts automatically to the changes you made. This may still sound a bit complicated, but trust me, with the detailed instructions I provide, it couldn't be easier! More about that on my [website](https://kevinakasam.com/lets-adapt-the-cad/).

## Bill of Materials + Instructions

As for my Belt-Mod, you can find all needed Hardware, STLs and instructions on my Website:

Some people have contacted me with the problem that the layers split when they insert the magnets. This happens when the magnet is too big for the hole/the hole is too small for the magnet. So either the magnets are a bit bigger than 6mm or your printer prints the holes too small (never use a caliper to measure the magnets!. Only if they are made of plastic!). How the printer prints the holes depends not only on the material (ABS shrinks a bit, while PETG stays fairly constant) but also on the orientation of the holes. Vertical holes are usually a bit smaller than the horizontal ones, the ones that are printed in the walls. This is because these holes are formed by the layers and can never be completely round (the circle is made of 0.2mm (layer height) lines). At the same time, the diameter is strongly influenced by the print settings (speed, acceleration, linear advance/pressure advance, etc.).

However, you may need different tolerances than I do. That is why I have designed a small tolerance test (_thanks to SchlongkyDong for the idea!_). As already described, the tolerances for vertical and horizontal holes can/will differ. Stick a screwdriver through the smaller holes to get your magnets out again.

## Wiring Guide
Since there is no polarity on Switches, it doesn't matter which wire goes where. Just connect the switch to the two marked pins.
In the next chapter about firmware changes you will see where to add the pin.

Wiring for the Rev2 is very easy. Simply unmount/unplug your old z-endstop and connect the probe to the z-endstop port.

## Firmware Guide
The KlackEnder probe works with Marlin and Klipper. This guide only shows you what changes you need to make to the firmware, not how to modify/upload the firmware itself. There are several guides online for different boards and printers.
**You do not have to use the ```Probe In``` or ```Probe Out``` macros.** They're just a nice to have. The printer will do this automatically when you send a ```G29```.


### Klipper

The installation for Klipper is pretty easy. Simply do the changes below and copy the code from the ```KlackEnder.cfg```to your ```printer.cfg```
The ```[gcode_macro G29]``` does the same like the ```[gcode_macro AUTO_BED_MESH]```. I just added this so you can use the G29 command as usual.
#### Changes to the existing config:
```
[stepper_z]
endstop_pin: probe:z_virtual_endstop #if you want to use the Prove as z-endstop (You can unsinstall the stock z endstop then. If not, remove the [homing_override])
#position_endstop: 0 #remove this or uncomment it with a #
position_min: -8 # set a negative value (minimum as the probe z_offset)


[stepper_x]
position_max: 250 #Your printhead have to move all the way to the right to pickup the probe. If your screw collides with the metal plate, simply flip it around.


##Following does not apply for the E3-V2##
[stepper_y]
position_min: -8 #most Ender 3 configs have this wrong. Between the nozzle and the bed is a gap of 8mm (Y dimension) when the printer is homed. If not adapt this and the -8 in the Probe_In Makro). 
position_endstop: -8

```
#### Add new config:

**Don't forgot to edit your probe Pin:**

### Marlin
The installation for Marlin requires some more changes, but I will guide you through this :). These changes are only to get the KlackEnder working correctly. You still need to configure the rest of the options as appropriate for your printer. Support for the KlackEnder and similar probes was only recently added so a current version of Marlin needs to be used. Go to ```https://marlinfw.org/meta/download/``` and download the ```bugfix-2.1.x```. Follow the instructions for downloading, Installing, and configuring VSCode. Before compiling with PlatformIO you will need to setup your config files. Go to ```https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/bugfix-2.1.x/config/examples/Creality``` find your Printer/board setup and down load the appropriate Configuration.h & Configuration_adv.h. At this point you will want to go through and make the changes below, once completed you should be good to compile and use your printer. We are working on getting Configuration files posted for common printer combinations as well as .bins uploaded with pre-compiled firmware for common setups.

Marlin will now include a probe deploy and stow option under the motion menu when the Mag_mounted probe is defined.

#### 1. Configuration.h

- Search for ```//#define USE_PROBE_FOR_Z_HOMING``` and uncomment by removing ```//``` before ```#define```
- Search for ```#define PROBE_MANUALLY``` and if not commented out with ```//``` comment it out with ```//```
- If you have plugged your Probe into the Z-Endstop you will need to uncomment ```//#define Z_MIN_PROBE_USES_Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_PIN```
  If you have plugged your Probe into the probe port on your board you don't need to touch this.

- Search for ``` //#define MAG_MOUNTED_PROBE```  uncomment by removing the ```//```
  and change the following lines to
  ```
  #define MAG_MOUNTED_DEPLOY_1 { PROBE_DEPLOY_FEEDRATE, { 245, 114, 20 } }  // Move to side Dock / Attach probe
  #define MAG_MOUNTED_DEPLOY_2 { PROBE_DEPLOY_FEEDRATE, { 200, 114, 020} }  // Move probe off dock
  //#define MAG_MOUNTED_DEPLOY_3 { PROBE_DEPLOY_FEEDRATE, { 245, 114, 20 } }  // lift probe up
  //#define MAG_MOUNTED_DEPLOY_4 { PROBE_DEPLOY_FEEDRATE, {   0,   0,  0 } }  // Extra move if needed
  //#define MAG_MOUNTED_DEPLOY_5 { PROBE_DEPLOY_FEEDRATE, {   0,   0,  0 } }  // Extra move if needed
  #define MAG_MOUNTED_STOW_1   { PROBE_STOW_FEEDRATE,   { 245, 114, 20 } }  // Move to dock
  #define MAG_MOUNTED_STOW_2   { PROBE_STOW_FEEDRATE,   { 245, 114,  0 } }  // Place probe beside remover
  #define MAG_MOUNTED_STOW_3   { PROBE_STOW_FEEDRATE,   { 220, 114,  0 } }  // Side move to remove probe
  #define MAG_MOUNTED_STOW_4   { PROBE_STOW_FEEDRATE,   { 220, 114, 20 } }  // Ensure probe is off
  //#define MAG_MOUNTED_STOW_5   { PROBE_STOW_FEEDRATE,   {   0,   0,  0 } }  // Extra move if needed
  ```
  Probe deploy and stow feed rate can be changed by editing the appropriate lines


- Search for ```NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET```  and change
  ```
  #define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET { 10, 10, 0 }

  // Most probes should stay away from the edges of the bed, but
  // with NOZZLE_AS_PROBE this can be negative for a wider probing area.
  #define PROBING_MARGIN 10
  ```

  to

  ```
  #define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET { 8, 21, 1.2 }   //--> set correct offset

  // Most probes should stay away from the edges of the bed, but
  // with NOZZLE_AS_PROBE this can be negative for a wider probing area.
  #define PROBING_MARGIN 15   //--> more clearance to the sides of the bed.
  ```
 
- Search for ```// @section geometry```  and change
  ```

  ## Marlin Setup Before printing
  Go into the menu->Motion->Unified Bed Leveling->UBL Custom Bed Mesh
  set your normal bed temp and hotend temp and then select custom mesh. This will probe all points that can be reached by the probe and then interpolate the rest.
  
  ## Marlin Slicer Start Gcode
  In your slicer Gcode look for a line that says 
  ```G28```
  after that line add in the following two lines
  ```
  G29 L0 ; load mesh saved in slot 0 which is the default slot
  G29 A ; activate bed mesh leveling.
  G29 J ; Probe 3 points and tilt the mesh loaded in slot 0 to match the current bed tilt
  ```


### Rev_1 vs. Rev_2 (and Rev_2.x)

What's the difference between Revision 1 and Revion 2?
                   
The most important difference is the position of the probe. With the Rev2, the probe is attached to the X-axis, which is why the probe can be used as a Z end stop. So no additional port for an end stop is needed and the probe can simply be connected to the old Z endstop port. The renders below show the difference, the upper one is the Rev2. (The Probe mount on the hotendplate is the same for both version)
